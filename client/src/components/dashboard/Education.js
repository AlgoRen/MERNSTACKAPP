// Purpose:
//    1) To return a table containing the user's education credentials.
//    2) To provide the ability to delete specific education credentials.

// How it works:
//    1) The Education function takes in education and the deleteEducation action as parameters.
//    2) A constant name educations is created to store the results of a map function.
//    3) The map function takes in a parameter edu as the single item of each value in the education
// array. The map creates a key by assigning edu._id to tr tag.
//    4) Table data is added with edu.school and edu.degree.
//    5) A Moment fragment is brought in using a YYYY/MM/DD format to format the edu.from and the edu.to
// values. If edu.to is null based on a ternary operator check, then a sting of " Now" is returned instead.
//    6) Lastly, for education.map function, a table data with a button that contains an onClick property
// that executes an anonymous function that calls deleteEducation passing in edu._id as a parameter.
//    7) The Education function returns a Fragment with a header of Education Credentials table HTML structuring
// containing the table head of School, Degree, and Years. The table body is const educations passed in as JSX.
//    8) The education state and deleteEducation action are defined in Education.propTypes. The educations
// state is defined as a required array. The deleteEducation action is defined as a required function.
