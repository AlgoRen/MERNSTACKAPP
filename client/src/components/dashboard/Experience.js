// Purpose:
//    1) To return a table containing the user's experience credentials.
//    2) To provide the ability to delete specific experience credentials.

// How it works:
//    1) The Experience function takes in experience state and the deleteExperiences action as parameters.
//    2) A constant name experiences is created to store the results of a map function.
//    3) The map function takes in a parameter edu as the single item of each value in the experience
// array. The map creates a key by assigning exp._id to tr tag.
//    4) Table data is added with exp.school and exp.degree.
//    5) A Moment fragment is brought in using a YYYY/MM/DD format to format the exp.from and the exp.to
// values. If exp.to is null based on a ternary operator check then a sting of " Now" is returned instead.
//    6) Lastly, for experience.map function, a table data with a button that contains an onClick property
// that executes an anonymous function that calls deleteExperiences passing in exp._id as a parameter.
//    7) The Experience function returns a Fragment with a header of Experience Credentials table HTML structuring
// containing the table head of Title and Years. The table body is const experiences passed in as JSX.
//    8) The experience state and deleteExperiences action are defined in Education.propTypes. The experiences
// state is defined as a required array. The deleteExperiences action is defined as a required function.
