# MERNSTACKAPP
Brad Traversy Social Network with MERN Stack Course Application

## Introduction
I began this project with the straight-forward task of coding along side Brad Traversy's MERN Stack Course to add to my portfolio and more importantly getting the experience of a full fledge full stack application. I found that
what Brad's course had to offer checked enough of the boxes of what I found as complexed or complicated when working with REST API and React. However, as time went on during the process of following a long I felt I was really just going with the routine of building the application, meaning I would watch the video, write the code, check to see if it worked and if I understood why it worked (mostly just assuming I did) then moving on unless I ran into a bug then I would check where I want wrong or if the forums had posted about the issue I was running into. Slowly, towards the end of following along and coding out the application I wanted a way to prove that I truly knew how to build an application like this without hand holding, that I knew enough about the fundamentals and how the independent pieces came together to create the working whole. I then came to the ideation of creating robust comments for the entire application, writing it out based on what I thought was going on, this ended up being a much bigger challenge with a much bigger reward than I expected. With that being said this repo is Brad Traversy Social Network with MERN Stack Course but with the added bonus of having every single file in application having a detailed explanation of how that file works so you can build a strong big picture understanding of why the code is written the way it is and how the reducers relate to actions, how models work with API routes, and how actions are called inside of components. 

### Details on the commenting work
The comments at the top of the files are the comments that I wrote after the completion of coding out the application. The comments that are inside of the code are what I wrote during development. The comments that are tagged by a * (if you use the BetterComments package they appear as light green) were written for my further explanation which may be inaccurate or unnecessaary when commenting for a team project but I decided to leave them in rather than delete them for the authenticity value, or maybe just so I can go back as time goes on and laugh at my comments, who knows.
